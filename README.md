# RISC: Risk and Incident Sharing and Coordination #

The goal of [RISC](http://openid.net/wg/risc/) is to provide data sharing schemas,
privacy recommendations and protocols to:

* Share information about important security events in order to thwart attackers from
leveraging compromised accounts from one Service Provider to gain access to accounts on
other Service Providers (mobile or web application developers and owners).
* Enable users and providers to coordinate in order to securely restore accounts
following a compromise.
