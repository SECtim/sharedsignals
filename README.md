# RISC: Risk and Incident Sharing and Coordination #

The goal of [SSE](http://openid.net/wg/sse/) is to provide data sharing schemas,
privacy recommendations and protocols to:

* Manage access to resources and enforce access control restrictions across distributed services operating in a dynamic environment.
* Prevent malicious actors from leveraging compromises of accounts, devices, services, endpoints, or other principals or resources to gain unauthorized access to additional systems or resources.
* Enable users, administrators, and service providers to coordinate in order to detect and respond to incidents.
