# SSE: Shared Signals and Events #

The goal of the Shared Signals and Events ([SSE](http://openid.net/wg/sse/)) Working Group is to enable the sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between related and/or dependent systems in order to:

* Manage access to resources and enforce access control restrictions across distributed services operating in a dynamic environment.
* Prevent malicious actors from leveraging compromises of accounts, devices, services, endpoints, or other principals or resources to gain unauthorized access to additional systems or resources.
* Enable users, administrators, and service providers to coordinate in order to detect and respond to incidents.
